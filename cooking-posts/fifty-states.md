Before I started documenting my cooking adventures, I did a challenge where every week I made a different Disney recipe that was based on a Disney movie we were watching in alphabetical order. It was really fun and I learned a lot about cooking along the way. I also discovered some awesome new foods with it, including [Jollof Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jollof_rice).

I decided for my next challenge, why not learn more about my country while maybe discovering new foods? This is my experience with trying an iconic dish from each of the US states in alphabetical order.

### Alabama

**White BBQ Sauce**

![White Sauce](/images/white_sauce.jpg 'White Sauce')

For Alabama, I read about this white barbeque sauce that's apparently really popular. It's a mayonaissey, vinegary, delicious concoction that I'll be making again for sure. It's creamy and tangy and compliments barbeque meat really well.

### Alaska

**Smoked Salmon Tea Sandwiches**

![Salmon Sandwiches](/images/salmon_tea_sandwiches.jpg 'Salmon Sandwiches')

This was really easy. Smoked salmon, cucumber, fresh dill, and cream cheese are what make up these little treats. I'll bet I could elevate this further, but as it was it was pretty good. Salmon is a chief export of Alaska, so I had to make something that contained it. I also learned that citizens of Alaska can get paid to live there as an incentive, which is really neat!

### Arizona

**Navajo Tacos**

![Navajo Tacos](/images/fry_bread_tacos.jpg 'Navajo Tacos')

I'll just say off the bat I don't think I made this correctly. I read that this is an iconic dish of Arizona that blends its American Indian heritage with Tex-Mex cuisine. I tried frying pizza dough that we had on hand from Trader Joe's. It ended up puffing up really large, and I think the idea is to actually have the fry bread be thinner. After adding the toppings it tasted like a Tex-Mex taco on a donut, which I wasn't fond of. I'd love another shot at making this correctly, or maybe just trying to accurately nail fry bread another time.

### Arkansas

**Chocolate Gravy**

![Chocolate Gravy](/images/chocolate_gravy.jpg 'Chocolate Gravy')

This is chocolate sauce. In Arkansas they like to eat it on biscuits. I don't know what more to say about this. It's fine if you like chocolate sauce on biscuits, but I'd rather not. The one thing I appreciated about making this was it taught me that making chocolate sauce from scratch is really easy, so if I want to make a decadent dessert with strawberries and chocolate sauce, it'd actually be very doable.

### California

**California Burritos**

![California Burritos](/images/california_burritos.jpg 'California Burritos')

I started by quick pickling some red onion and throwing steak on a pan. When that and fries were out of the oven, I put red onions, steak, fresh cilantro, fries, and shredded cheese on a flour tortilla. After wrapping that up and putting it on the pan until the outside was a little crispy, I put it in the microwave for about 20 seconds or so to melt the cheese.

This was good! The fries were actually great in a California style burrito. I think I'd like to get a more authentic burrito tortilla in the future so I can get more chewiness out of it, and I'll remember to get avocado next time as well, but this was still really good.

### Colorado

**Pueblo Slopper Burgers**

![Pueblo Burger](/images/pueblo_burger.jpg 'Pueblo Burger')

This sounded really strange to me, but I kept seeing these "Slopper Burgers" show up when I was looking up characteristically Colorado foods. Apparently in Pueblo Colorado, due to their state wide love of green chili sauce, they decided at some bar to pour it over a burger and eat it with a fork and knife.

![Pueblo Burger Prep](/images/pueblo_burger_prep.jpg 'Pueblo Burger Prep')

I decided to buy premade green chili sauce and heat it up in a sauce pan. It sounds like the other required portion is just a well made burger, so garlic paste, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika went into the ground beef and I put that on a fry pan with olive oil. Tex mex style shredded cheese went on the burger and thinly sliced tomatoes. After toasting the buns and assembling, I just poured the hot green chili sauce over the top and I was worried the texture would be really off putting, but I actually liked it. I'll probably make this odd dish again some day.

### Connecticut

**Steamed Cheeseburgers**

![Steamed Cheeseburger](/images/steamed_cheeseburger.jpg 'Steamed Cheeseburger')

According to [America's Library](https://www.americaslibrary.gov/es/ct/es_ct_burger_1.html#:~:text=Do%20you%20know%20how%20they,sandwiches%20to%20local%20factory%20workers.), the first hamburgers were invented in a shop in 1895 in Connecticut. I decided to go with an older style of making burgers to celebrate this, so I tried steaming some cheeseburgers.

![Cheeseburger Setup](/images/cheeseburger_setup_no_top.jpg 'Cheeseburger Setup')

I don't own a steamer so I had to make up my own setup, but it was really easy. After forming the patties with some salt, pepper, and garlic paste, I put them in a colander on top of a pot with boiling water in it.

![Cheeseburger Setup With Lid](/images/cheeseburger_setup.jpg 'Cheeseburger Setup With Lid')

I just put the lid on that and steamed them for about 7 minutes and they came out great. Steamed burgers are really easy and you avoid a lot of the grease this way. They're not quite as tasty as a smash burger, but they're very little cleanup, still tasty, and I feel like they were probably lower in the fat content as well.

### Delaware

**Slippery Dumplings**

![Slippery Dumplings](/images/slippery_dumplings.jpg 'Slippery Dumplings')

I don't know why so many iconic American dishes have to have names that sound so unappealing. Slippery dumplings originated from Delaware and consist of your typical chicken soup ingredients but with a thin dumpling as the carb.

![Slippery Dumplings Prep](/images/slippery_dumplings_prep.jpg 'Slippery Dumplings Prep')

I buttered the pan and started by cooking the veggies until they were ready, and put the chicken breast in with the chicken stock. I just use Better than Bouillon for this because it's easy and it tastes great.

While that cooked I used flour, baking powder, salt, and vegetable oil to make a dough along with a cup and a half of the stock. After 30 minutes I took the chicken out and put the dough in after flattening it out and cutting it into slivers. After cooking that for 10 minutes, you get a thick consinstency with the stock and as the name would imply, some slippery dumplings to pour over the chicken. This was good, but I do think I just prefer a nice bowl of chicken soup.

### Florida

**Key Lime Pie**

![Key Lime Pie](/images/key_lime_pie.jpg 'Key Lime Pie')

Ok, I didn't technically use key limes for this, but I can't imagine it really matters. Zest of limes, about 3/4 a cup of lime juice, greek yogurt (I went full fat for the creaminess), and sweetened condensed milk make up the filling and I just put that into a Kroger graham cracker crust.

After that's in the oven at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, you just let that sit for 30 minutes and then it goes in the fridge for at least 3 hours. I made homemade whipped topping for this by just taking some heavy whipping cream and using a hand mixer with that for a while until it was fluffy. I'd actually never done this so it was cool to see how easy it is to make whipped topping with just heavy whipping cream and then some confectioner's sugar mixed in afterwards.

![Whipped Cream](/images/whipped_cream.jpg 'Whipped Cream')

This took surprisingly little effort, tasted awesome, and is kinda fancy shmancy looking. I'd love to make this when hosting guests as a way to flex some dessert making skills.

### Georgia

**Fried Green Tomatoes**

Fried Green Tomatoes are awesome. I kind of cheated with this one because I don't think they technically originate from Georgia, but I love the movie [Fried Green Tomatoes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101921/) and that movie took place in Georgia, so I couldn't resist.

![Green Tomato Prep](/images/green_tomato_prep.jpg 'Green Tomato Prep')

Pretty simple flour, egg, and then cornmeal and bread crumb mixture stations to dredge the green tomato slices in, and then afterwards they just go into a frying pan with some vegetable oil. I made a remoulade on the side which is just a cold mayonnaisey pickley sauce to dip the fried green tomatoes in and it was so good.

![Green Tomatoes](/images/green_tomatos.jpg 'Green Tomatoes')

### Hawaii

**Kalua Pork**

This probably isn't accurate to the true way this is made at all, since the true method for making this seems to involve burying the meat and barbequing it that way, or at least that's how they do it on Bon Appetit in [this video](https://youtu.be/2XhBMaPJjl0?t=313) that I love.

I just used liquid smoke and cooked the pork in the crock pot to emulate a smoky flavor and to get some decent tenderness from the pork. White rice and grilled pineapple on the side made this a really tasty meal.

### Illinois

**Chicago Style Hot Dogs**

I wanted to make my own half sour pickles for this referencing [this video](https://youtu.be/vD6XWXj9l8Q), again getting some inspo from Bon Appetit. Unfortunately I did something wrong, maybe because I didn't include garlic with the brine or I got the salinity wrong, but the pickles came out super gross, and I don't think I care to try it again.

But regardless the chicago style hot dogs were really good that I made, failed pickles aside! Probably my favorite learning here was that steaming hot dog buns is worth the effort.

### Indiana

**Breaded Tenderloin Sandwich**

This was a surprise hit. I was interested in these when I was looking up Indiana recipes because I'd never had a fried pork sandwich. All you need to do is cut up some pork tenderloin and fry it up after tenderizing and flattening out the meat.

I made these into sliders by cutting the meat small and putting them on small buns with just some pickle and ketchup. They were really good and I'll probably make them again.

![Breaded Tenderloin](/images/breaded_tenderloin.jpg 'Breaded Tenderloin')

### Iowa

**Maid Rite Sandwiches**

I don't know if I made these correctly. They're loose ground beef sandwiches that are simple and supposed to be really good. I avoided recipes with onion because my stomach isn't particularly fond of onions, but I think they're required to have this taste right. I also used chicken stock with it and avoided using butter for the same reason as the onions, and it ended up tasting pretty bland.

![Maid Rite](/images/maid_right.jpg 'Maid Rite')

### Kansas

**Open Face Roast Beef Sandwiches**

I asked my boss who's from Kansas what kind of meals he grew up with in Kansas. One of the ones that caught my eye were these open face roast beef sandwiches with gravy. I just used roast beef deli meat, McCormick gravy, and some toasted italian bread slices with some provologne melted on top.

It was good, but I want to make it even better next time with some real roast beef that has come out of a crock pot or instant pot.

![Roast Beef Sandwich](/images/roast_beef_sandwich.jpg 'Roast Beef Sandwich')

### Kentucky

**Hashbrown Casserole**

Some thawed frozen hashbrowns, shredded cheddar cheese, cream of chicken, sour cream, and corn flakes make up a dish that I found described on Allrecipes as something a Kentucky grandma would make. It was decent but probably not something I'll bother with again, casserole's not really my thing.
