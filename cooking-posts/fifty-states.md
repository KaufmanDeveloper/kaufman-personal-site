Before I started documenting my cooking adventures, I did a challenge where every week I made a different Disney recipe that was based on a Disney movie we were watching in alphabetical order. It was really fun and I learned a lot about cooking along the way. I also discovered some awesome new foods with it, including [Jollof Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jollof_rice).

I decided for my next challenge, why not learn more about my country while maybe discovering new foods? This is my experience with trying an iconic dish from each of the US states in alphabetical order.

### Alabama

**White BBQ Sauce**

For Alabama, I read about this white barbeque sauce that's apparently really popular. It's a mayonaissey, vinegary, delicious concoction that I'll be making again for sure. It's creamy and tangy and compliments barbeque meat really well.

### Alaska

**Smoked Salmon Tea Sandwiches**

This was really easy. Smoked salmon, cucumber, fresh dill, and cream cheese are what make up these little treats. I'll bet I could elevate this further, but as it was it was pretty good. Salmon is a chief export of Alaska, so I had to make something that contained it. I also learned that citizens of Alaska can get paid to live there as an incentive, which is really neat!

### Arizona

**Navajo Tacos**

I'll just say off the bat I don't think I made this correctly. I read that this is an iconic dish of Arizona that blends its American Indian heritage with Tex-Mex cuisine. I tried frying pizza dough that we had on hand from Trader Joe's. It ended up puffing up really large, and I think the idea is to actually have the fry bread be thinner. After adding the toppings it tasted like a Tex-Mex taco on a donut, which I wasn't fond of. I'd love another shot at making this correctly, or maybe just trying to accurately nail fry bread another time.

### Arkansas

**Chocolate Gravy**

This is chocolate sauce. In Arkansas they like to eat it on biscuits. I don't know what more to say about this. It's fine if you like chocolate sauce on biscuits, but I'd rather not. The one thing I appreciated about making this was it taught me that making chocolate sauce from scratch is really easy, so if I want to make a decadent dessert with strawberries and chocolate sauce, it'd actually be very doable.

### California

**California Burritos**

I started by quick pickling some red onion and throwing steak on a pan. When that and fries were out of the oven, I put red onions, steak, fresh cilantro, fries, and shredded cheese on a flour tortilla. After wrapping that up and putting it on the pan until the outside was a little crispy, I put it in the microwave for about 20 seconds or so to melt the cheese.

This was good! The fries were actually great in a California style burrito. I think I'd like to get a more authentic burrito tortilla in the future so I can get more chewiness out of it, and I'll remember to get avocado next time as well, but this was still really good.

### Colorado

**Pueblo Slopper Burgers**

This sounded really strange to me, but I kept seeing these "Slopper Burgers" show up when I was looking up characteristically Colorado foods. Apparently in Pueblo Colorado, due to their state wide love of green chili sauce, they decided at some bar to pour it over a burger and eat it with a fork and knife.

![Pueblo Burger Prep](/images/pueblo_burger_prep.jpg 'Pueblo Burger Prep')

I decided to buy premade green chili sauce and heat it up in a sauce pan. It sounds like the other required portion is just a well made burger, so garlic paste, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika went into the ground beef and I put that on a fry pan with olive oil. Tex mex style shredded cheese went on the burger and thinly sliced tomatoes. After toasting the buns and assembling, I just poured the hot green chili sauce over the top and I was worried the texture would be really off putting, but I actually liked it. I'll probably make this odd dish again some day.
